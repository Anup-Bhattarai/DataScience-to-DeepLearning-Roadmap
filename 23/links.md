## 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
**PCA** is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional form while preserving as much variance as possible. This is crucial for visualization and reducing noise in data. 📉

## 2. Anomaly Detection  
**Anomaly Detection** involves identifying rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. This is important for fraud detection, network security, and fault detection. 🚨
