## 1. Web App using Streamlit  
Streamlit is an open-source app framework that allows you to turn your data scripts into shareable web apps quickly. It’s user-friendly and integrates seamlessly with Python data libraries. Here’s why I prefer Streamlit for ML web deployment:

### Why I Prefer Streamlit
- **Ease of Use**: Streamlit is intuitive and requires minimal coding, allowing data scientists to focus on modeling rather than web development.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly build and iterate on prototypes, seeing real-time changes as you develop.
- **Seamless Integration**: It works well with popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Interactivity**: Create interactive visualizations and user interfaces with just a few lines of code.
- **Flexible Deployment**: Easily share your app via Streamlit Sharing or other platforms.

### Alternatives to Streamlit
If you’re looking for different options, consider:
- **Flask**: A lightweight framework for custom web applications but requires more setup.
- **Django**: A robust framework for larger applications, good for complex needs.
- **Dash**: Designed for analytical web apps, great for visualizations.
- **Gradio**: Focuses on creating user interfaces for machine learning models quickly.
- **Voila**: Converts Jupyter notebooks into interactive web apps.
